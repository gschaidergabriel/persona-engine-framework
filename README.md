# persona-engine-framework

**A framework for building stable, synthetic writing identities using LLMs.**  
Includes a Writing Matrix, constraint system, drift-control mechanisms, and an agent workflow for generating consistent, high-quality replies at scale.

## 🧠 What is this?

This is not a prompt.  
This is a modular architecture for creating a synthetic writing identity that behaves like a consistent persona across hundreds of AI-generated replies.

It enables:
- Tonal consistency  
- Semantic stability  
- Drift prevention  
- Rapid reply generation  
- Scalable presence without loss of voice

## 🔍 Why does it exist?

Most AI-generated text drifts.  
It lacks identity, rhythm, ethics, and coherence over time.

This framework solves that by externalizing style, defining constraints, and stabilizing narrative behavior — turning LLMs into agents of consistent voice.

## ⚙️ How does it work?

The system consists of:

- `Writing Matrix`: defines tonal, semantic, and rhythmic structure  
- `Constraint System`: enforces stylistic and ethical boundaries  
- `Saboteur Mechanism`: prevents over-optimization and genericity  
- `Drift Control`: maintains voice across replies  
- `Agent Workflow`: generates 30 replies in 30 minutes with zero editing  
- `Screenshot Curation`: selects only high-quality outputs for posting

## 🚀 How to use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Read `/framework/writing-matrix.md`  
3. Define your own matrix and constraints  
4. Set up your agent (see `/agent/agent-setup.md`)  
5. Generate replies, curate via screenshot  
6. Post with zero commentary — the voice speaks for itself
