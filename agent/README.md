# Agent

The `agent` folder contains everything required to operate the synthetic writing identity as a functional system.  
While the `framework` folder defines the identity architecture, the `agent` folder explains how that architecture is executed in practice.

This section covers setup, workflow, and real examples of the agent in action.

## 📁 Included Documents

### **1. agent-setup.md**
Describes how to configure the LLM-based agent using:
- the Writing Matrix  
- constraints  
- semantic anchors  
- drift-control  
- style rules  

This file provides the full prompt structure, recommended layering, and the operational logic behind the agent.

---

### **2. workflow.md**
Explains the complete high‑volume reply generation workflow:
- input collection  
- agent generation  
- drift evaluation  
- curation  
- posting  

This workflow enables fast, consistent output (e.g., 30 replies in 30 minutes) while maintaining identity integrity.

---

### **3. examples.md**
Contains real example outputs generated by the synthetic identity.  
These examples demonstrate:
- tone  
- structure  
- rhythm  
- reasoning patterns  
- minimalistic style  

They serve as reference material for contributors and users.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Agent Layer

The agent layer exists to operationalize the identity architecture.  
It transforms the framework from a theoretical model into a working system capable of:

- consistent communication  
- scalable output  
- drift-resistant behavior  
- predictable reasoning  
- high-quality replies with minimal editing  

The agent is not a chatbot.  
It is a **controlled writing system** built on top of the identity architecture.

## 🧠 Core Insight

The framework defines *how the identity works*.  
The agent defines *how the identity acts*.

Together, they form a complete synthetic writing engine.
