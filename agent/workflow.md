# Workflow

This workflow describes how to generate high-quality replies using the synthetic writing identity.  
It is optimized for speed, consistency, and minimal editing.

## 1. Overview

The workflow consists of:

1. Input collection  
2. Agent generation  
3. Drift evaluation  
4. Curation  
5. Posting  

This cycle allows for 30 high-quality replies in 30 minutes.

## 2. Step-by-Step Workflow

### **Step 1 — Input Collection**
Gather prompts, comments, or posts you want to reply to.  
Keep them short and clean.

### **Step 2 — Agent Generation**
Send each input to the agent using the full identity architecture.

### **Step 3 — Drift Evaluation**
Check each output for:
- tone consistency  
- structural alignment  
- semantic clarity  
- absence of generic AI tone  

If drift is detected → regenerate.

### **Step 4 — Curation**
Use a screenshot-based workflow:
- select only the best outputs  
- discard anything that feels off  
- keep the identity sharp  

Curation is part of the system.

### **Step 5 — Posting**
Post the curated replies without commentary.  
The voice should speak for itself.

## 3. Quality Criteria

A reply is considered high-quality if it is:
- concise  
- structured  
- minimalistic  
- context-aware  
- stylistically aligned  
- free of drift  

---

## 4. Regeneration Rules

Regenerate when:
- tone becomes verbose  
- structure collapses  
- emotional coloration appears  
- identity weakens  
- output feels generic  

Regeneration is not a failure — it is maintenance.

---

## 5. Scaling the Workflow

To scale output:
- batch inputs  
- generate in parallel  
- curate in waves  
- maintain strict quality control  

This allows for high-volume, high-consistency communication.

## 6. Purpose of the Workflow

The workflow ensures:
- stability  
- speed  
- consistency  
- identity integrity  

It transforms the agent from a chatbot into a writing system.
