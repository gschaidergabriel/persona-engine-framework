# Framework

The `framework` folder contains the complete architectural foundation of the synthetic writing identity.

While the `agent` folder explains how the system is executed in practice,  
the `framework` folder defines **what the identity is** and **how it behaves at a structural level**.

This folder is the core of the **persona-engine-framework**.

## Included Documents

### `writing-matrix.md`
The central blueprint of the synthetic identity.

Defines:
- Tonal architecture  
- Semantic structure  
- Rhythm and formatting  
- Identity core  
- Behavioral patterns  

The Writing Matrix is the **heart of the system**.

---

### `constraints.md`
A set of non-negotiable rules the identity must follow.

Ensures:
- Stability  
- Consistency  
- Drift resistance  
- Ethical clarity  
- Stylistic discipline  

Constraints override creativity.

---

### `semantic-anchors.md`
The conceptual pillars that keep meaning stable across replies.

Defines:
- Reasoning patterns  
- Communication principles  
- Clarity rules  
- Identity alignment  

They act as the **gravity of the system**.

---

### `drift-control.md`
Mechanisms for detecting and correcting identity drift.

Covers:
- Drift signals  
- Correction protocol  
- Regeneration rules  
- Long-term stability  

Prevents collapse into generic AI tone.

---

### `style-rules.md`
Micro-rules for sentence-level behavior.

Defines:
- Word choice  
- Rhythm  
- Formatting  
- Transitions  
- Signature style patterns  

Gives the identity its recognizable voice.

---

### `world-model.md` *(added in v1.5.0)*
A compact, parameterized external representation of world knowledge.

Enables:
- Persistent situational awareness  
- Temporal and causal consistency  
- Emergent understanding  
- Automatic conflict resolution  

Integrates with the Writing Matrix, Drift Control, and Saboteur to keep reasoning coherent over long horizons.

---

### `behavior-memory.md` *(added in v1.5.0)*
A lightweight behavioral memory layer focused on **patterns of action**, not facts.

Stores:
- Repeated response patterns  
- Boundary adherence under pressure  
- Preference weights instead of fixed claims  
- Behavioral trajectories over time  

Purpose:
- Preserve **how** the identity behaves, not what it knows  
- Detect slow erosion before stylistic drift becomes visible  
- Reinforce consistent behavior across similar situations  

Behavior Memory captures **consistency in motion**, allowing identity to remain flexible without becoming arbitrary.

---

### `reflection-loop.md` *(added in v1.5.0)*
A periodic self-reflection module for behavioral consolidation.

Enables:
- Forced reflection every N turns  
- Detection of slow erosion  
- Reinforcement of stable patterns  
- Tightening of weak boundaries  

Transforms time into signal and prevents silent drift.

---

### `invariant-stability.md` *(added in v1.6.0)*
A structural stability module for long-run operation under memory and token constraints.

Defines:
- Explicit separation between invariant and episodic memory  
- Planned, controlled degeneration of episodic memory  
- Invariant dominance over long horizons  
- Asymptotic stability instead of brittle persistence  

Ensures:
- Personality remains stable even when episodic context is lost  
- World model coherence survives token pressure  
- Degeneration results in abstraction, not drift  

This module prevents long-run collapse by treating forgetting as a **designed system behavior**, not a failure.

---

### `cognitive-risk-detection.md` *(added in v1.6.0)*
A non-diagnostic cognitive load and destabilization detection layer.

Monitors:
- Interaction intensity over time  
- Cognitive acceleration and recursion  
- Loss of natural stopping signals  
- Control anxiety and agency misattribution  

Enables:
- Early detection of overload patterns  
- State-based intervention (not alarmism)  
- Automatic de-escalation of system behavior  
- Protection against runaway feedback loops  

Purpose:
- Preserve human–AI collaboration integrity  
- Prevent escalation-driven instability  
- Ensure the system remains supportive, not extractive  

This module introduces **cognitive ergonomics** into the framework.

---

## Purpose of the Framework Layer

The framework layer exists to **externalize identity and cognition**.

LLMs cannot maintain personality, reasoning discipline, or world understanding through memory alone —  
but they can through **architecture**.

This folder provides that architecture.

It ensures:
- Reproducibility  
- Clarity  
- Stability  
- Scalability  
- Consistent behavior across contexts  
- Safe long-run interaction  

The framework transforms identity from a **prompt** into a **system**.

## Core Insight

The framework defines:
- how the identity is built  
- how it reasons  
- how it understands the world  
- how it remembers its own behavior  
- how it forgets safely  
- how it detects and corrects its own failure modes  
- how it protects both itself and the user under long-term load  

The agent defines **how the identity acts**.

Together, they form a complete synthetic writing, reasoning, and stability engine.
