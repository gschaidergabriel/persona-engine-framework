# Framework

The `framework` folder contains the complete architectural foundation of the synthetic writing identity.  
While the `agent` folder explains how the system is executed, the `framework` folder defines *what* the identity is and *how* it behaves at a structural level.

This is the core of the persona-engine-framework.

## 📁 Included Documents

### **1. writing-matrix.md**
The central blueprint of the synthetic identity.  
Defines:
- tonal architecture  
- semantic structure  
- rhythm and formatting  
- identity core  
- behavioral patterns  

The Writing Matrix is the heart of the system.

---

### **2. constraints.md**
A set of non-negotiable rules that the identity must follow.  
These constraints ensure:
- stability  
- consistency  
- drift resistance  
- ethical clarity  
- stylistic discipline  

Constraints override creativity.

---

### **3. semantic-anchors.md**
The conceptual pillars that keep meaning stable across replies.  
Anchors define:
- reasoning patterns  
- communication principles  
- clarity rules  
- identity alignment  

They act as the gravity of the system.

---

### **4. drift-control.md**
Mechanisms for detecting and correcting drift.  
Covers:
- drift signals  
- correction protocol  
- regeneration rules  
- long-term stability  

This file ensures the identity does not collapse into generic AI tone.

---

### **5. style-rules.md**
Micro-rules for sentence-level behavior.  
Defines:
- word choice  
- rhythm  
- formatting  
- transitions  
- signature style patterns  

These rules give the identity its recognizable voice.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Framework Layer

The framework layer exists to externalize identity.  
LLMs cannot maintain personality through memory — but they can maintain identity through architecture.

This folder provides that architecture.

It ensures:
- reproducibility  
- clarity  
- stability  
- scalability  
- consistent behavior across contexts  

The framework transforms the identity from a prompt into a system.

## 🧠 Core Insight

The framework defines **how the identity is built**.  
The agent defines **how the identity acts**.

Together, they form a complete synthetic writing engine.
