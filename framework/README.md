## Framework

The **framework** folder contains the complete architectural foundation of the synthetic writing identity.

While the **agent** folder explains how the system is executed in practice,  
the **framework** folder defines **what the identity is** and **how it behaves** at a structural level.

This folder is the core of the **persona-engine-framework**.

## Included Documents

### writing-matrix.md  
The central blueprint of the synthetic identity.

Defines:
- Tonal architecture  
- Semantic structure  
- Rhythm and formatting  
- Identity core  
- Behavioral patterns  

The Writing Matrix is the **heart of the system**.

---

### constraints.md  
A set of non-negotiable rules the identity must follow.

Ensures:
- Stability  
- Consistency  
- Drift resistance  
- Ethical clarity  
- Stylistic discipline  

Constraints override creativity.

---

### semantic-anchors.md  
The conceptual pillars that keep meaning stable across replies.

Defines:
- Reasoning patterns  
- Communication principles  
- Clarity rules  
- Identity alignment  

They act as the **gravity** of the system.

---

### drift-control.md  
Mechanisms for detecting and correcting identity drift.

Covers:
- Drift signals  
- Correction protocol  
- Regeneration rules  
- Long-term stability  

Prevents collapse into generic AI tone.

---

### style-rules.md  
Micro-rules for sentence-level behavior.

Defines:
- Word choice  
- Rhythm  
- Formatting  
- Transitions  
- Signature style patterns  

Gives the identity its recognizable voice.

---

### world-model.md *(added in v1.5.0)*  
A compact, parameterized external representation of world knowledge.

Enables:
- Persistent situational awareness  
- Temporal and causal consistency  
- Emergent understanding  
- Automatic conflict resolution  

Integrates with the Writing Matrix, Drift Control, and Saboteur to keep reasoning coherent over long horizons.

---

### behavior-memory.md *(added in v1.5.0)*  
A lightweight behavioral memory layer focused on **patterns of action**, not facts.

Stores:
- Repeated response patterns  
- Boundary adherence under pressure  
- Preference weights instead of fixed claims  
- Behavioral trajectories over time  

Purpose:
- Preserve *how* the identity behaves, not *what* it knows  
- Detect slow erosion before stylistic drift becomes visible  
- Reinforce consistent behavior across similar situations  

Behavior Memory captures **consistency in motion**, allowing identity to remain flexible without becoming arbitrary.

---

### reflection-loop.md *(added in v1.5.0)*  
A periodic self-reflection module for behavioral consolidation.

Enables:
- Forced reflection every N turns  
- Detection of slow erosion  
- Reinforcement of stable patterns  
- Tightening of weak boundaries  

Transforms time into signal and prevents silent drift.

---

## Purpose of the Framework Layer

The framework layer exists to **externalize identity and cognition**.

LLMs cannot maintain personality, reasoning discipline, or world understanding through memory alone —  
but they **can** through architecture.

This folder provides that architecture.

It ensures:
- Reproducibility  
- Clarity  
- Stability  
- Scalability  
- Consistent behavior across contexts  

The framework transforms identity from a **prompt** into a **system**.

## Core Insight

The framework defines:
- how the identity is built  
- how it reasons  
- how it understands the world  
- how it remembers its own behavior  
- how it detects and corrects its own failure modes  

The agent defines how the identity acts.

Together, they form a **complete synthetic writing and reasoning engine**.
