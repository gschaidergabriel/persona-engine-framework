# Framework

The **framework** folder contains the complete architectural foundation of the synthetic writing identity.

While the **agent** folder explains **how the system is executed**, the **framework** folder defines **what the identity is** and **how it behaves at a structural level**.

This folder is the **core of the persona-engine-framework**.

## Included Documents

### `writing-matrix.md`
The central blueprint of the synthetic identity.

Defines:
- Tonal architecture  
- Semantic structure  
- Rhythm and formatting  
- Identity core  
- Behavioral patterns  

The **Writing Matrix** is the heart of the system.

---

### `constraints.md`
A set of non-negotiable rules that the identity must follow.

Ensures:
- Stability  
- Consistency  
- Drift resistance  
- Ethical clarity  
- Stylistic discipline  

**Constraints override creativity.**

---

### `semantic-anchors.md`
The conceptual pillars that keep meaning stable across replies.

Defines:
- Reasoning patterns  
- Communication principles  
- Clarity rules  
- Identity alignment  

They act as the **gravity of the system**.

---

### `drift-control.md`
Mechanisms for detecting and correcting drift.

Covers:
- Drift signals  
- Correction protocol  
- Regeneration rules  
- Long-term stability  

Prevents collapse into generic AI tone.

---

### `style-rules.md`
Micro-rules for sentence-level behavior.

Defines:
- Word choice  
- Rhythm  
- Formatting  
- Transitions  
- Signature style patterns  

Gives the identity its **recognizable voice**.

---

### `world-model.md` *(new)*
A compact, parameterized external representation of world knowledge.

Enables:
- Persistent situational awareness  
- Causal inference  
- Emergent understanding  
- Conflict resolution  

Integrates with the Writing Matrix and Saboteur for **long-term coherence and proactivity**.

---

## Purpose of the Framework Layer

The framework layer exists to **externalize identity and cognition**.

LLMs cannot maintain personality or world understanding through memory alone —  
but they **can** through architecture.

This folder provides that architecture.

It ensures:
- Reproducibility  
- Clarity  
- Stability  
- Scalability  
- Consistent behavior across contexts  

The framework transforms the identity from a **prompt** into a **complete system**.

## Core Insight

The **framework** defines how the identity is built and how it understands the world.  
The **agent** defines how the identity acts.

Together, they form a complete **synthetic writing and reasoning engine**.
